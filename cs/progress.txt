updating Hardwareviewmodel; changed from hardwareresrouce => productresource
UI can't fit all headers well, not sure how much to change it

Next Steps:
*Looking for temperature reading property... escalate
need to implement filter/logic for internal/ext cal data to be shown
edit worker.cs

8/9/18:
working on Filter in worker.cs
issue is that FindHardware returns hardwareresourcebase but in hardwareviewmodel we have productresource class

Looks like product resource inherits from hardwareresourcebase >> hardwareresource >> productresourcebase >> productresource

Tried casting (Line 14 of HardwareViewModel: ProductResource productResource = resource as ProductResource;) maybe? no errors

simulated device needed for testing. program runs fine but nothing to test with

added internal/external support if statements (HardwareViewModel line 22, 28)

Next Steps:
-Confirm if temperature property exists or not
-make field red if calibration date is overdue
-test w/ hardware (simulated or not). Change back 'IsSimulated' property to False for filter
